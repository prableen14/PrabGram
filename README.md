# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

I am using Appwrite in this project. 
Appwrite is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform designed to simplify and accelerate the development of modern applications by providing developers with a set of ready-to-use backend services. It offers a variety of functionalities such as user authentication, database management, cloud storage, and server-side functions, among others. Here are some of its key features:

User Authentication: Appwrite provides built-in support for various authentication methods, including email and password, OAuth providers (like Google, Facebook, GitHub), and more, making it easy to manage user accounts and sessions.

Database Management: It includes a NoSQL database where developers can store and manage their application data. It supports complex queries, real-time subscriptions, and permissions.

Cloud Storage: Appwrite allows storing and managing files, images, and other media. It also handles file uploads, storage limits, and permissions.

Server-Side Functions: Developers can write and deploy custom server-side functions (also known as "Cloud Functions") to extend their application's backend logic.

APIs and SDKs: Appwrite provides RESTful APIs and client SDKs for multiple programming languages and platforms, including JavaScript, Dart, Flutter, Node.js, and more, allowing developers to integrate its services easily into their applications.

Real-Time Capabilities: It supports real-time features such as database subscriptions and event-based triggers, enabling dynamic and responsive applications.

Security: Appwrite includes robust security features like role-based access control, data encryption, and secure communication protocols to ensure the safety and integrity of application data.

Appwrite is designed to be self-hosted, meaning developers can run it on their own servers, giving them full control over their backend environment. It is particularly favored for its flexibility, ease of use, and comprehensive feature set, which can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to develop and maintain the backend infrastructure of web and mobile applications.
